1. Adapt Agent and Tool responses to be coherent so that either can be called directly in a graph and the handling isn't too complex
2. be able to maintain number of plan steps and tool choices upon revision (add prompt-based checks for this at least, if not hard checks)


Adds:
1. Upon ingress, scan each paper for key themes, gaps, etc. and for each paper store the metadata (title, authors, etc.), the citation, the summary analysis with themes+gaps, and the chunks themselves
2. Mapping relevant chunks in clustering to the citations as it relates to generating a writeup. The citations must be real, there cannot be hallucinated citations in the writeup. Refer to STORM as well for this.

Adds Jan 2025:
1. Marker PDF has LLM support now...
2. review of writing outputs via AI-PI
3. Task-specific models
4. Avoiding hallucinations by ensuring any citations are real - see what storm does?
