The tool we envision is\nbased on NLP techniques able to detect and classify PICO elements and medical terms and\norganize abstracts accordingly. Preliminary results on the PICO element classi\ufb01cation of\nabstract sentences show that a BERT + bi-LSTM language model trained on an automatically\ngenerated dataset performs adequately on a real case. Our proposed tool is expected to\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduce the effort for producing medical guidelines and therefore have a strong,\n\n---\n\nof computer science and algorithms. Furthermore, a living systematic literature review [ 29],\nwhich examined published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies,\nshowed that more than 90% of the publications evaluated developed classi\ufb01ers that used\nrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the main target texts, while only a small number of\ntools extracted data from observational studies. These are major limitations that should be\naddressed in order to implement automatic or semi-automatic support systems for experts\nwho want to conduct systematic literature reviews on broad and mainly unknown topics,\nsuch as SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19.\n1.2.

To do so, we organized this paper into two\nmain parts.
