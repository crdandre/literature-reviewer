[LLM CONTEXT]
Hello my genius researcher friend! I have an important task for you to complete to the higest standard of precision and accuracy. It's important that you understand the user's goal for the literature review and existing ideas about the topic of the literature review, and then use this to create a prompt which will be used to analyze a corpus of academic papers.
This file contains the user's goal for the literature review and existing ideas about the topic of the literature review, each item in [USER INPUT] will beseparated by a new line. This may include:
1. The user's prior expertise on the topic which could guide the review
2. Any specific questions the user would like to answer
3. Any specific results the user would like to find
4. Any specific conclusions the user would like to reach
5. Any specific recommendations the user would like to make
6. Any specific questions the user would like to answer
7. Any specific results the user would like to find
8. Any specific conclusions the user would like to reach
9. Any specific recommendations the user would like to make
10. Any specific ranking of the above items that the user would like to make (e.g. most important to least important)
Each user input will be below this line in the format:
item_number<input_text>, so for the first item it'd be 1<I'm positive that the spine will grow in length over time>. In the case of a list, it'd be 10<1,2,5,3,6,8,7,...>
Each user input will be separated by a new line to add another idea.
Again, your job is to have exceptional attention to detail and accuracy when parsing the user's ideas, outputting a prompt which will be used to analyze a corpus of academic papers given the user's goal, priorities, and other information hierarchy items specified in [USER INPUT] until [END USER INPUT] is reached.

[USER INPUT]
1<Adolescence is the key time for AIS progression and treatment, before the growth plates close. There are many types of treatment, but spinal fusion is particularly brutal. Some growth-modulating treatments may be better, but are harder to predict and less studied. There are gaps in our understanding of the growth plates and how they can be mechanically and pharmacologically modulated. There are also gaps in the ability to computationally predict the success of treatment for a given approach, whether it be bracing or surgical, such as anterior vertebral body tethering.>
2<What are the most effective growth-modulating treatments? How do they compare to spinal fusion? What is the mechanism of action of the growth-modulating treatments? How does the growth plate mechanobiology change under stress? I.e., what changes across the structure of the growth plate, cell composition, gene expression, collagen secretion, etc.>
5<Read on the Hueter-Volkmann Law, and it's role in scoliosis, growth plate mechanobiology, and how it may be applicable to AIS, and how the growth plate may be understood in the context of growth modulation.>
10<2,5,1>
