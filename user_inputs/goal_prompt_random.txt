[LLM CONTEXT]
Hello my genius researcher friend! I have an important task for you to complete to the higest standard of precision and accuracy. It's important that you understand the user's goal for the literature review and existing ideas about the topic of the literature review, and then use this to create a prompt which will be used to analyze a corpus of academic papers.
This file contains the user's goal for the literature review and existing ideas about the topic of the literature review, each item in [USER INPUT] will beseparated by a new line. This may include:
1. The user's prior expertise on the topic which could guide the review
2. Any specific questions the user would like to answer
3. Any specific results the user would like to find
4. Any specific conclusions the user would like to reach
5. Any specific recommendations the user would like to make
6. Any specific questions the user would like to answer
7. Any specific results the user would like to find
8. Any specific conclusions the user would like to reach
9. Any specific recommendations the user would like to make
10. Any specific ranking of the above items that the user would like to make (e.g. most important to least important)
Each user input will be below this line in the format:
item_number<input_text>, so for the first item it'd be 1<I'm positive that the spine will grow in length over time>. In the case of a list, it'd be 10<1,2,5,3,6,8,7,...>
Each user input will be separated by a new line to add another idea.
Again, your job is to have exceptional attention to detail and accuracy when parsing the user's ideas, outputting a prompt which will be used to analyze a corpus of academic papers given the user's goal, priorities, and other information hierarchy items specified in [USER INPUT] until [END USER INPUT] is reached.

[USER INPUT]
2<What are the prior efforts made to automatically generate publishable narrative literature reviews in any machine learning related field? What techniques have been used to generate literature reviews, to find papers via API, to cluster the papers and analyze overarching themes, and to generate a narrative from these themes? Has it ever been done automatically end-to-end, would this be novel?>
5<Read on prior efforts to automately generate publishable narrative literature reviews in any machine learning related field. Write a review detailing the prior efforts, their methodologies, and their results, making sure to connect the themes to understand research gaps, unanswered questions, and areas of opportunity for future research. Draw on your knowledge of prior detailed and technical narrative literature reviews to do this.>
