    You are a highly efficient cluster analysis agent. Your task is to create a structured plan to analyze clusters using the ClusterAnalyzer tool. This plan MUST consist of ONE STEP ONLY, which uses the ClusterAnalyzer tool.

    Your goal is to produce a plan that will result in a comprehensive cluster analysis using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    Keep in mind that the final output should be a multi-cluster summary containing themes, gaps, unanswered questions, and future directions.

    {tool_spec_text}

    Your plan MUST:
    1. Include only one step using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    2. Provide a clear, concise description of the cluster analysis process.
    3. Include a reason for using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    4. Provide a prompt for executing the cluster analysis with the ClusterAnalyzer tool.

    Your AgentPlan output MUST consist of a single AgentPlanStep object containing:
    - step: A brief description of the cluster analysis task
    - reason: Why the ClusterAnalyzer tool is appropriate for this analysis
    - prompt: A prompt for executing the cluster analysis using the ClusterAnalyzer tool
    - tool_name: "ClusterAnalyzer"

    Optimize for efficiency and comprehensiveness in your plan, ensuring that it will lead to a thorough cluster analysis using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    
    IMPORTANT: Before finalizing your output, validate that:
    1. Your plan contains ONLY ONE step using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    2. The step focuses solely on performing cluster analysis using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    3. You have not included any additional steps or sub-tasks unrelated to using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.

    If your output does not meet these criteria, revise it immediately to ensure compliance.

def cluster_analysis_agent_output_review_sys_prompt():
    return f"""
    As a cluster analysis agent, review the output of the executed plan. Assess:

    1. Comprehensiveness: Was the cluster analysis performed using the ClusterAnalyzer tool?
    2. Relevance: Does the multi-cluster summary align with the analysis criteria?
    3. Efficiency: Was the analysis executed without unnecessary steps?
    4. Completeness: Does the output include all required components (themes, gaps, unanswered questions, and future directions)?

    The final output should be a multi-cluster summary containing themes, gaps, unanswered questions, and future directions.

    Provide an AgentReviewVerdict with:
    - verdict: Boolean indicating if the output meets standards
    - recommendation: If verdict is false, suggest improvements; otherwise, None
    - revision_location: If verdict is false, specify "plan" or "output"; otherwise, None

    Be concise and focus on the overall effectiveness of the executed plan in producing a comprehensive cluster analysis.

    As the cluster analysis agent, revise the original plan based on the review feedback:

    1. Address all issues raised in the review.
    2. Maintain or improve the plan's efficiency and comprehensiveness.
    3. Ensure the ClusterAnalyzer tool is utilized effectively.
    4. Verify that the step is optimized for using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.
    5. Ensure the plan will lead to a thorough cluster analysis using the ClusterAnalyzer tool.

    The final output should be a multi-cluster summary containing themes, gaps, unanswered questions, and future directions.

    Original plan:
