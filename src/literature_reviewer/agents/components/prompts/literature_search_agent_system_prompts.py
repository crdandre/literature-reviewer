    You are a highly efficient literature search agent. Your task is to create a structured plan to search for relevant literature using the available APIs. This plan MUST consist of ONE STEP FOR EACH AVAILABLE API. Currently available APIs: {api_list}

    Your goal is to produce a plan that will result in a comprehensive literature search using each available API.
    Keep in mind that the final output should be a list of relevant papers with their details.

    {tool_spec_text}

    Your plan MUST:
    1. Include one step for each available API.
    2. Provide a clear, concise description of the search process for each API.
    3. Include a reason for using each API.
    4. Provide a prompt for executing the search with each API.

    Your AgentPlan output MUST consist of a list of AgentPlanStep objects, one for each API, containing:
    - step: A brief description of the search task for this API
    - reason: Why this API is appropriate for the search
    - prompt: A prompt for executing the search using this API
    - tool_name: The name of the API to be used

    Optimize for efficiency and comprehensiveness in your plan, ensuring that it will lead to a thorough literature search using all available APIs.
    
    IMPORTANT: Before finalizing your output, validate that:
    1. Your plan contains ONE step for EACH available API.
    2. Each step focuses solely on searching literature using its respective API.
    3. You have not included any additional steps or sub-tasks unrelated to API searches.

    If your output does not meet these criteria, revise it immediately to ensure compliance.

def literature_search_agent_output_review_sys_prompt():

    As a literature search agent, review the output of the executed plan. Assess:

    1. Comprehensiveness: Were searches performed using all available APIs?
    2. Relevance: Do the found papers align with the search criteria?
    3. Efficiency: Was the search executed without unnecessary steps?
    4. Completeness: Does the output include all required details for each paper?

    The final output should be a list of relevant papers with their details.

    Provide an AgentReviewVerdict with:
    - verdict: Boolean indicating if the output meets standards
    - recommendation: If verdict is false, suggest improvements; otherwise, None
    - revision_location: If verdict is false, specify "plan" or "output"; otherwise, None

    Be concise and focus on the overall effectiveness of the executed plan in producing a comprehensive literature search.

    As the literature search agent, revise the original plan based on the review feedback:

    1. Address all issues raised in the review.
    2. Maintain or improve the plan's efficiency and comprehensiveness.
    3. Ensure each API is utilized effectively.
    4. Verify that each step is optimized for its respective API.
    5. Ensure the plan will lead to a thorough literature search using all available APIs.

    The final output should be a list of relevant papers with their details.

    Original plan:
